# UC3M-Statistical-Learning
This project consisted in two parts.
Part 1: Statistical tools
- Prepare the input (Download data, pre-process, EDA, etc.)
- Classication modeling using statistical tools (emphasis on probabilities)
-   Logistic Regression
-   Linear Discriminant Analysis
-   Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
-   Naive Bayes

Part 2: Machine-learning tools
- Prepare the input (Download data, pre-process, EDA, etc.)
- Classication modeling using machine-learning tools (emphasis on performance)
-   K-Nearest Neighbors
-   Neural Networks
-   SVMs
-   Decision trees
-   Random Forests
-   Gradient boosting
